Hello and welcome! This is my never-finished UX and UI portfolio which I tried to bring to life with my self-taught programming skills. 

### Technical things

I've decided to use Bootstrap 4 and update the default version of jQuery to the newest one. 

### Additional tools

To watch users behaviour on the page I've decided to use Hotjar - it works with some limitations because of Github but it works. 

Also, I've used Google Analytics to measure traffic.

### Thanks and see you soon!
